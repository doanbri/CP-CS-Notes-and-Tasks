## *Faker Code* 

IF “awake” then  
‘print “good morning”  
ELSE  
‘print “wake up”  
END  

const code =  
‘print “hello world”  
 print “hello again  
const.grand = new Grand(codes)  
grand.run()  

task setup();  
_var_= not  
*dur* (answer == "not"):  
  if(choice == "1"):  
    print("wrong")  
    answer = "chosen"  
  *edur*(choice == "2"):  
    print("wrong")  
    answer = "chosen"  
  *edur*(choice == "3"):  
    print("wrong")  
    answer = "chosen"  
  else:  
    print("no")  

__In this “Faker Code” the way you make a variable would be _var_. I did this because it shorter then writing variable. task is for functions like setup,draw,print, and others. To make a looping project you would add either ^loop^ or ^noloop^.__
